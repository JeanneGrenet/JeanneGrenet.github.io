## Realisation

### Context

First of all, I am starting the formation "Développeur.se informatique" at CESI in October 2023. That's why I started working on HTML/CSS to realize this portfolio. 

### Technologies

I am using HTML to create the content of the website and after CSS to recreate the template that I first did on Wordpress. I also add other categories like certifications, in order to highlight my abilities. 

### Updating 

I'm going to put my new projects when they’re done and I'm also going to put new certifications.
